  <section class="section section-anchor">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The Road to Home Foundation walks alongside individuals who are unsheltered or battling addiction.
      We help connect people to shelter, treatment, mental health support, food, and community.
      We believe recovery is possible, and no one should have to walk that road alone.

  <!-- Memorial for Delino -->

    <h2>In Loving Memory of Delino Garcia</h2>
    <p>
      Delino Garcia was more than a name. He was a loving brother, a good son, a fun uncle,
      and a hardworking man who traveled the country behind the wheel of a big rig.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved football games, new cities, and the little things like collecting shot glasses
      from the places he visited. He loved hard, worked hard, and carried his family in his heart
      everywhere he went.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 16px;">His Road, His Legacy</h3>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <span>Family First:</span> He was a protector and a symbol of strength for his loved ones.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <span>On the Road:</span> As an over-the-road truck driver, he saw more states and highways than most people ever will.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <span>Heart of Gold:</span> He helped others, gave what he could, and always looked out for his people.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <span>Forever Loved:</span> His family, friends, and community will carry his name, his laugh, and his spirit forever.
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 14px;">
      The Road to Home Foundation is a living tribute to Delino. The same highways he drove on are the roads
      where many people sleep, struggle, and search for hope. In his honor, we choose to show up for them.
      Every meal given, every resource shared, every person helped off the street — it’s part of his story now, too.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 16px;">A Message to Delino</h3>
    <p>
      We miss you every day. You traveled across this country and now you’ve traveled somewhere our eyes can’t see yet.
      We carry you in our hearts, in our work, and in every life we touch through this foundation.
      This is for you, little brother. Always.
